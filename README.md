# Sync-intern-task-1-Alarm-clock

Step 1: Import necessary modules
We'll need the time and os modules in Python to implement the alarm functionality.

Step 2: Define the alarm function
The alarm function will wait for the specified time and then play a sound or display a message to notify you that the alarm has gone off.

Step 3: Get user input for the alarm time
Ask the user to input the time they want the alarm to go off and validate the input format.

Step 4: Main function to run the alarm clock
In the main function, call the get_alarm_time() function to get the alarm time from the user and then pass it to the set_alarm() function.

Step 5: Running the alarm clock
When you run the Python script, it will prompt you to enter the alarm time in the format "HH:MM:SS." After entering the time, the script will continuously check the current time against the alarm time, and once the alarm time is reached, it will display the message "Time's up! Alarm triggered!".

Remember, this simple example runs the alarm on the command line and does not include a sound-playing feature. If you want to play a sound, you can use additional libraries like pygame or playsound to do so. Keep in mind that you may need to install these libraries separately before using them.
